\title{Round numerical data}
\usage{
round(data_in, dp = 2, as_text = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_in}{The data to be rounded, supplied as a (vector of) numeric or logical; or as data object of class table, matrix, data.frame or tibble (any of which can contain non-numeric columns)}

\item{dp}{The number of decimal places to round to (default is 2), supplied as either as single number to be applied to all numeric values, or as a series vector of values (one per column of the input data object, in column order, using NA for factor/string columns)}

\item{as_text}{If TRUE (default is FALSE), and data_in is of class table, returns a table in which all numeric values have been converted to strings, so that the dp per column used for display matches that used for rounding}
}
\value{
An updated version of the supplied data object containing rounded numeric values
}
\description{
Round numerical data

\examples{
# Create toy example for rounding demo
survey2 <- survey |>
  dplyr::select( Tenure, Height, Income, Household_w0, Person_w0 ) |>
  dplyr::slice( 1:5 )

# gdslStats::round as a replacement for base::round
round( 1.1234 )
round( 1.1234, dp = 1 )

# Rounding of a data.frame including a non-numeric column
round( data_in = survey2 )

# Rounding each numeric column differently
round( data_in = survey2, dp = c(NA, 1, 2, 3, 4) )

# Rounding each column of a tibble differently
round( tibble::as_tibble( survey2), dp = c(NA, 4, 1, 3, 2) )

# Rounding each column of a table differently
# Note the need to use as_text = TRUE to display result as expected
survey |> tab( Age ~ Sex, measure = "row_pct" ) |> round( dp = c(1,3) )
survey |> tab( Age ~ Sex, measure = "row_pct" ) |>
 round( dp = c(1,3), as_text = FALSE )
